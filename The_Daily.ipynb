        "#Exploring Sleep Debt & Health Markers\n",
        "\n",
        "Literature shows that the type of good health I seek, that of a physically fit athlete, is best examined with the following rubric.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. According to Wikipedia: \"Sleep debt or sleep deficit is the cumulative effect of not getting enough sleep. A large sleep debt may lead to mental or physical fatigue. There are two kinds of sleep debt: the results of partial sleep deprivation and total sleep deprivation.\" My biggest concern is that sleep deprivation is an indicator of brain degeneration in the elderly. My goal is to work on trending my sleep debt down through sleep hygiene techniques.\n",
        "2. Resting heart rate (RHR) can be the result of a high level of fitness, meditative breathing, and sleep. There are other reasons, such as disease, diet, family history, and medication, which can result in a low resting heart rate. For my health purposes, I expect to see that when I am healthy and doing self-care (such as meditation, high cardio workouts, sleep hygiene, etc.), my resting heart rate will be relatively steady. And if trends present themselves, the RHR will be trending down.\n",
        "3. Maximum heart rate (MHR) is the number of beats the heart makes during strenuous exercise. While a high heart rate can be a sign of a medical issue, it is also an indicator of good health. If during use, the heart beats more often as a result of the exercise, it can be a sign of proper conditioning. There is always a countervailing pressure that as the heart becomes more conditioned, it beats slower. My goal is to grow my MHR or at least stay on an even trendline.\n",
        "4. Heart rate variability (HRV) is the interplay between the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system. During relaxation, the HRV goes up, and during stress and exercise, the HRV goes down. HRV plays a role as a good indicator of recovery from illness, anxiety, and training. My goal is to drive my average HRV score up over time.\n",
        "5. Calories burned beyond primary body function are an indication of a strengthened heart which lowers the RHR, encourages the MHR upward, and promotes healthy sleep patterns.\n",
        "6. REM sleep is a phase of sleep that lasts approximately 25% of any sleep period. It is commonly associated with the processing of learning, memory, and emotional state. Excessive strain, alcohol, and medical issues can suppress REM sleep. While there are exceptions due to circumstances of medicines, drink, and illness, a healthy sleep pattern should involve rough parity between time spent in REM and deep sleep.\n",
        "7. Deep sleep, or slow-wave sleep, is a phase of sleep most commonly associated with the body recovering from physical exertion during the previous awake period. Excessive strain, alcohol, and medical issues can suppress deep sleep (also called delta wave sleep). While there are exceptions due to circumstances of medicines, alcohol, and illness, a healthy sleep pattern should involve rough parity between time spent in REM and deep sleep."
